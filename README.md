## 10 Second Animal
**Number of players:** At least 3

**Requires:** Paper and markers

**Rules:**

* One person starts the round by naming an animal and keeping time
* Everyone else draws the animal named
* At ten seconds, everyone stops and shares their drawings
* The leader picks the winner. The leader can pick the winner based on any criteria they want - the best, the silliest, the cutest, etc. 
* The winner then leads the next round
* Rinse and repeat

## Poorly Described
**Number of players:** At least 3

**Requires:** Prework - Each player picks a couple of movies, or television shows and describes them poorly yet accurately. For example, the clue might be "Group spends 9 years returning jewelry" and the answer would be "Lord of the Rings".

**Rules:**

* A person starts the round by announcing movie or TV and reading their clue
* Everyone else guesses potential movies or TV shows
    * If no one guesses correctly, the reader may provide clues
* The winner then reads their clue
* Rinse and repeat

## Pictionary
**Number of players:** At least 4

**Requires:** 

* A whiteboard or drawing app. Zoom includes a whiteboard option under the Screen share menu. 
    * Other whiteboard options include any paint program on the drawer's computer, or [webwhiteboard.com](https://www.webwhiteboard.com/)
* [Random word generator](https://randomwordgenerator.com/pictionary.php)

**Rules:**

* Divide everyone into two teams
* Determine which team will go first and pick the first person to draw
* The drawer uses the random word generator to generate a word
* The drawer shares their screen
  * Tip: Make sure to generate the word before sharing your screen
* Once the drawer starts drawing, a member of the other team times them for 90 seconds
* Team members shout out guesses of what the word is during the drawing process
  * Don't actually shout
* On a successful guess, that team is awarded a point or kudos
* If the team is unable to guess the correct answer, the other team has an opportunity to steal by providing a single guess

**Alternatives:**

* [skribbl.io](https://skribbl.io/) is an online pictionary clone that allows for up to 12 people to participate in a single game. One person generates the game link and shares it in zoom. There are no teams, so everyone participates at the same time. 

## Punderful
**Number of players:** At least 3

**Requires:** Using the [Scattergories generator](https://swellgarfo.com/scattergories/) and setting it to provide 2 categories

**Rules:**

* Someone shares their screen and generates two categories
* Everyone tries to come up with a terrible pun using those categories
  * For example, if the categories were "States" and "Diet Foods" your pun might be "Have you heard about the lobster diet? Yeah, it's my Maine meal"
* Everyone reads their puns and a winner is picked based on any criteria - best groaner, wittiest, most absurd, etc.
* Note: The definition of a pun for this game is loose to non-existent - any joke, wordplay, or silliness using the categories is well within the bounds

## Scattergories
**Number of players:** At least 4

**Requires:** A [Scattergories generator](https://swellgarfo.com/scattergories/)

**Rules:**

* Pair off into teams of two
* Someone shares their screen of the Scattergories generator
  * I recommend setting the number of categories to 10 and clicking 'restart'
* A team volunteers to go first and play begins (click 'start')
* Team members provide answers to the categories beginning with the designated letter
* After the time is up, if any answers were not provided the group as a whole can provide potential answers

**Alternative play**

* Casual: Without teams, the group as a whole provides answers to the categories - providing interesting, obscure, or funny answers is encouraged

## Conductor
**Number of players:** At least 3

**Requires:** Paper, markers, and ideas for things to draw. If stuck use the [Pictionary word generator](https://randomwordgenerator.com/pictionary.php) for ideas

**Rules:**

* Everyone takes turns being the conductor
* The conductor chooses what to "draw" and brandishing an invisible pencil (baton) slowly draws it in the air in front of the camera
* The "orchestra" members (everyone else) attempt to follow along and draw what the conductor is drawing
* Everyone shows their drawings and the conductor chooses the closest likeness
